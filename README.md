### What I learned

I learned that you can apply the border-radius property to a parent element and have it be visible through the children elements by hiding overflow. Sadly this solution didn't fit with my code and caused a bug to appear, but it is something interesting and something that I will be experimenting with in the future. 

```scss
// The solution to the border-radius on wrapping div problem
.wrapper {
  border-radius: 10px;

  overflow: hidden; // Clips off the corners on the children elements
}

// The alternative fix
@mixin mq {
  @media (min-width: $br--laptop) {
    @content;
  }
}

@mixin wrapRadius($radius) {
    &:first-child {
        border-radius: 0;
        border-top-left-radius: $radius;
        border-top-right-radius: $radius;

        @include mq {
            border-radius: 0;
            border-top-left-radius: $radius;
            border-bottom-left-radius: $radius;
        }
    }

    &:last-child {
        border-radius: 0;
        border-bottom-left-radius: $radius;
        border-bottom-right-radius: $radius;

        @include mq {
            border-radius: 0;
            border-top-right-radius: $radius;
            border-bottom-right-radius: $radius;
        }
    }
}

.wrapper { @include wrapRadius(10px); }
```


### Continued development

For the future, I plan to continue honing my Grid skills as I have done with this project.
